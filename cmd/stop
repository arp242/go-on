	Stop the remote server.

	This currently works by issuing a "halt" or "shutdown" command, which
	requires some admin privileges:

	    macos    sudo halt         assumes NOPASSWD in /etc/sudoers
	    windows  shutdown /s /f    assumes user is Administrator
	    other    su -m root        assumes no root password
	EOF

# TODO: wait for machine to stop; stopping + starting a machine is tricky now;
#       e.g. Windows takes a minute and the PID will still exist. Maybe also add
#       restart.
#
# TODO: often exits with a non-0 status code because the shutdown command causes
#       the ssh connection to be stopped.
