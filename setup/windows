- Install Go from the installer at go.dev; this will add go to %PATH% and
  "go.exe" should work from the prompt.

- Setup ssh: on Windows 10 at least this can be done from services

- Enable sshd to start on boot from services

- Fuck about with ssh keys and permissions; by default it refuses to use the key
  because weird and confusing permission errors

      Bad permissions. Try removing permissions for user: S-1-5-21-2815334774-776037288-1646662406-1002 on file C:/Users/martin/.ssh/authorized_keys.

  What the fuck does that even mean? I can't find a reference to that "user"
  anywhere.

  In C:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config set "StrictMode no" and that fixes it.

  To log to the log file, use LOCAL0. The event viewer is useless.
